            <p>We are open Friday-Sunday. We also are open on some Mondays and on the Fourth of July. We currently only have one location, but we plan to expand soon to other locations within Maryland and eventually to other states. For our current location we are the only Drive-In theater in the DMV area. We are located at 400 Church Rd Upper Marlboro, MD 20774 USA. We are down the street from Six Flags America, 21 miles from Washington DC, 21 miles from Alexandria, and 36 miles from Baltimore.  </p>

        <h2>What to do once you arrive</h2>
        <p>You will be greeted by attendees at the box office. Once you pay, if you are in a sedan, you are welcome to park anywhere.</p>
        <p>We asked that trucks and SUVs park towards the back of the field. This is to ensure there is an equal viewing space for all vehicles. You are then welcome to go to our concession stand where our attendees will take your order and provide you with your choice of snack or beverage. We also have a playground on site for young ones while you wait till show time. Once show time is near, one of our technicians will come by to assist you if you need help setting your radio up. We will remind everyone of the house rules before the show starts. Once the movie is over a security member will direct cars out row by row. DO NOT try to leave before a security member tells you to. This is to ensure that everyone leaves in a safe manner. </p>
        <p> If you have anymore questions or inquires about renting out the theater for a birthday, summer camp, fields trips, or any other events. Please email us and we can try and arrange that for you</p>
