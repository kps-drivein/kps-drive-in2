            <h2>The Story of KP's Drive-In</h2>
            <p>We have been bringing smiles to the community since 2018 with our 49-foot-high and 120 feet wide screen. Which is one of the highest in the whole state might I add. We use a digital projector like most theaters. Which is constantly checked and monitored. Along with the best projector we also have the highest-quality sound system that works directly through FM radio transmission. We are on 6,000 square feet of land. With over 10 rows of parking and with a capacity of 220 vehicles. </p>
            <p>We have 20 attendees here to help you through your movie experience. Their roles range from box office attendee, food and beverage attendee, and attendee who manage technical operations. We also have a separate group of employees focusing on security and maintaining a safe environment. All attendees are skilled and trained in their field. Due to us only having 1 screen, tickets are normally for double features. Those double features can consist of the two biggest movies out or for situations when it's a sequel or remake we will show the original before. Also, in October we offer horror movie double feature. Those movies will range from slashers to the more kid friendly films and of course free candy for your little ones. In December we offer a similar double feature but for Christmas movies of course. Along with that we host classical nights where we show movies from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. </p>
            <p>Our mission is to bring the kids of this to a classic experience of a drive in theater. While also providing the same level of entertainment, quality, and experiences of a regular theater. Our goal is to help children realize that you can have the full movie experience going anywhere and not just in the theater. We help to build connections with the community, help bring awareness to this form of cinema and create long-lasting memories for families and friends. </p>
